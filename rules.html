                <h2>Rules of Engagement</h2>
                <p>Before we bring you onboard, please note that we have a core value here. We endeavour to make every member feel welcome in this squadron through respect, equality, and by displaying a positive attitude. There are a few additional rules that we expect all members to comply with as well:</p>
                <list>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You must be a minimum age of 18</li>
                        <li>You must comply with the squadron core value above, always</li>
                        <li>Avoid political discussion</li>
                        <li>While we are generally a light-hearted bunch who enjoy humourous conversation, we don’t appreciate anything that is racist, sexist, homophobic or anything else that is overly offensive to other members.</li>
                        <li>If you post something that a squadron officer deems inappropriate for the server, it will be removed and you will be warned. If you continue to do so, this could result in a kick/ban.</li>
                    </ol>
                </list>
                <hr>
                <p>We fly multiple times a week, with one campaign mission generally happening on a weekday at 9:00 PM ET. There are additional practice nights, non-campaign missions and small-scale missions happening at sporadic times as well. If you play Arma 3, we also run those missions as well. Keep an eye on the server for the mission times and sign-ups to be announced!</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Lastly we do have a tradition here... Once you have flown with us for a while, you will receive a callsign that will be decided by the other members of the Squadron. Note that this callsign isn’t necessarily one you may like, but that generally how callsigns work.</p>
